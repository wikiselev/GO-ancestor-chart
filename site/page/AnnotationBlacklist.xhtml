<h2>Scope</h2>
This method aims to correct annotations to UniProtKB accessions, from incorrect annotations inferred from electronic annotation (IEA) methods that are supplied by the UniProt-GOA project to the GO Consortium.

<h2>The need for a blacklist</h2>
The process of changing incorrect electronically inferred annotations is not instantaneous and in some cases these annotations are displayed for a while before the prediction method can be corrected at source.
<br/>
In some cases it is not possible for the IEA source to remove the annotation (see note 1, below).

<div style="font-style:italic; margin-top:10px">Example: False positives</div>
In the case where proteins are grouped together by a sequence model and the model hits a false positive, the 'false positive' protein would receive incorrect annotation(s).

<h2>Contents</h2>
This list contains UniProtKB protein accessions associated with specific GO terms that curators feel incorrectly describe a protein's function, associated process or subcellular location. This list is split into three sections:
<br/>
<h3>1. Negative associations curated from IEA pipeline review</h3>

A list of protein-GO term associations that have been observed as being incorrect from the review of annotations obtained from an IEA pipeline. These associations are often added when a curator has observed that a function/process term is being over-predicted to a group of proteins.
<br/>
These associations are not present in the UniProt-GOA annotation set, as there is no published sequence or experimental data to specifically negate these associations. However, curator knowledge has been used to assert these undesirable associations.
<div style="margin-left:50px; margin-top:5px">
	<div style="font-style:italic">Note:</div>
	Some electronic annotation sources have a cut-off criterion such that if the annotation is true for 95% of the proteins in the set, it is considered relevant for GO mappings to be added to the FULL protein set.
	<br/>
	This blacklist endeavours to highlight those proteins that may have been caught out in the 5% to provide users with as correct a set of protein annotations as possible.
</div>

<h3>2. Negative associations obtained from NOT-qualified GO annotations (annotation set updated weekly)</h3>

These protein-GO term associations have been created when a protein has been expected to have a particular function, associated process or location, but specific experimental or sequence-based evidence has been curated to demonstrate the contrary. These NOT-qualified GO annotations are obtained from the current UniProt-GOA annotation set and are updated weekly. GO Consortium guidance on curator usage of the NOT-qualifier is available here: <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/GO.annotation.conventions.shtml#not">http://www.geneontology.org/GO.annotation.conventions.shtml#not</a>

<h3>3. Negative associations obtained from UniProt COMMENT_CAUTION entries (annotation set updated weekly)</h3>

These protein-GO term associations have been created when a 'caution' comment in the UniProt entry indicates that a protein does not have the expected function, process or location. These comments are added manually by UniProt curators after reviewing the sequence or literature.

<h2>Custodian of the blacklist</h2>
The <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA" target="_blank">UniProt-GOA project</a> is responsible for maintaining the annotation blacklist for annotation sources originating from this group.
